\section*{Group averaging of exoplanet likelihoods}
\noindent
\textit{by} \textbf{Hogg} \textit{for} \textbf{Shu} \textit{with help from} \textbf{Villar}.

\paragraph{Abstract:}
The idea is to figure out how to do group averages (or Bayesian marginalizations) of likelihood functions, very fast.

\begin{problem}[toy]
Imagine that we have a code handle to a scalar function $f(\theta)$ that is a function of an angle $\theta\in U(1)$.
We don't know the form or value of this function \textsl{a priori} but we have code that can evaluate the function at any angle $0\leq\theta<2\pi$ or at any list of angles.
We believe that this function could be reasonably well approximated by a low-degree polynomial of trig functions, or
\begin{equation}
    f(\theta) \approx \Re\left\{\sum_{m=0}^M a_m\,\exp(i\,m\,\theta)\right\} ~,
\end{equation}
where $M$ is a small integer, and the $a_m$ are complex numbers (which we don't know).
We seek to find an estimate or value of the average $\mean{f}$ or marginalization
\begin{equation}
    \mean{f} = \frac{1}{2\pi}\,\int_0^{2\pi} f(\theta)\,\dd\theta
\end{equation}
taking as few evaluations of $f(\theta)$ as possible.
Additionally, we would like some assessment of the quality of the approximation, or at least a flag if the approximation is poor.
\end{problem}

\begin{conjecture}
If $f(\theta)$ is indeed well approximated by a polynomial of degree $M$, then we can get a good estimate of the average $\mean{f}$ with only $2\,M+1$ function evaluations.
\end{conjecture}
